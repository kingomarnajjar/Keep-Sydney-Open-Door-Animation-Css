# Door opening animations with CSS
 _A Pen created at CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/thecoderpenguin/pen/xxGzxKW](https://codepen.io/thecoderpenguin/pen/xxGzxKW).

 Testing out animating opening doors on click using CSS animations. Cross browser testing results:

Chrome Desktop: great!
IE 11: can do the rotating animation OK, but the door is the same on both sides
Firefox: OK, some issues with overlapping doors that might be fixable with absolute positioning & z-indexes
Safari iOS 8: great with prefixed CSS
